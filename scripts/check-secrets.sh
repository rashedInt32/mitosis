# Blocking by design: a credential that reaches a public remote is scraped
# within minutes and is not recoverable -- deleting the line or rewriting
# history does not un-leak it.

# Escape hatch for a false positive is .gitleaksignore, not an env var: the
# fingerprint gets committed and reviewed alongside the code. An env-var bypass
# would be trivially settable by any agent running commits in this repo, which
# defeats the point.
